  "description": "Prestige Estates Projects invites proposals for comprehensive waterproofing solutions for their premium residential project 'Prestige Lakeside Habitat' consisting of 8 residential towers (G+15 floors each) in Bengaluru. The extensive scope covers terrace waterproofing for all 8 towers totaling 40,000 sq ft of exposed terrace area including proper slope correction, treatment of cracks and joints, application of polymer-modified cementitious waterproofing systems or liquid membrane systems, and heat-reflective coating on top surface to reduce heat absorption and lower cooling costs. External wall treatment includes dampness diagnosis and treatment for existing seepage issues, crack filling and surface preparation, application of water-repellent coatings that allow breathability while preventing water ingress, and treatment of window and door perimeters to prevent leakage. Basement waterproofing covers negative side waterproofing for basement walls (approximately 15,000 sq ft), treatment of floor slabs and sumps, and installation of drainage channels if required. Expansion joint sealing includes inspection and re-sealing of all expansion joints in buildings using flexible polyurethane or polysulfide sealants. The selected contractor must use ISI certified materials, provide 10-year comprehensive warranty against water seepage backed by insurance, conduct thorough pre-work inspection and submit detailed reports with photographs, work in phases to minimize inconvenience to residents, and complete entire project within 4 months. Heat-reflective terrace coating should reduce surface temperature by minimum 15-20 degrees Celsius. Post-work water testing and certification mandatory. Experience in large residential complexes with minimum 500 apartments is essential.",
